_You are to imagine that you run a small software engineering house that specialises in the development of Software as a Service (SaaS) web applications built on the Ruby on Rails (Rails)
framework that has recently received an invitation from a potential client to design a prototype/proof-of-concept for an app named MyQuote.
The information provided by the potential client is as follows.

MyQuote App Overview
